        <h1 class="profile-title">Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal</h1>
        <p class="profile-blurb">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to become a full-stack developer. Throughout this career change, I've been learning a lot about the different technologies, frameworks, and languages that make web development possible.</p>

      <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
      <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
        <br><br>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
      </p>
      <h3>How I got started</h3>
      <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
        <br><br>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
